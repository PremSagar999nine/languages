<li>You can create strings with " or '
</li>
<li>.length is a property that gives you the length of a string</li>
<li>
.toUpperCase() and.toLowerCase() is a function that converts the string to upper case andlower case
</li>
<li>parentheses () on function calls are required. .length is a property that is already pre-computed; therefore, it does not need parentheses</li>
<li>Square brackets [index] are used to access a specific index from a string</li>
<li>The .at() method allows you to read a character at an index (which can also be negative)</li>
<li>string.substring(indexStart, indexEnd) is used to return a portion of the string</li>
<li>support interpolation with the  `I am learning ${language}`</li>
<li>Convert from a number to string: value.toString()</li>
<li>
The remainder operator (%) returns the division remainder between 2 numbers</li>
<li> let for variables that you will need to re-assign later on (as in changing their value)</li>
<li>const for variables that you won't need to re-assign later on</li>
<li>Variables declared with const cannot be re-assigned so you cannot have the = next to that variable name after declaring it</li>
<li>Using an if condition, you can run a piece of code when the condition evaluates to true</li>
<li>The syntax is if (condition) and then curly braces {} wrap the lines of code that correspond to this condition</li>
<li>The else keyword can be used to perform some other code based on all the other conditions not satisfied with the if.</li>
<li>Equal to (=) is an assignment operator</li>
<li>Double equals (==) is a comparison operator</li>
<li>Triple equals(===) is a strict equality comparison operator in JavaScript</li>
<li>const data = [1, 2, 3] is an array containing 3 numbers,square brackets</li>
<li>Arrays defined with const are not constants because you can change the elements inside of it. However, you cannot re-assign them to another value thus they will always be an array</li>
<li>The .filter() method returns a new array that contains some of the items from the original array, based on the condition you specify.</li>
<li>The array .map(callback) method allows you to transform an array into another one</li>
<li>An object is a data type that allows you to group several variables together into one variable that contains keys and values</li>
<li>In JavaScript, the recommended convention is camelCase for property names (for example firstName instead of first_name)</li>
<li>To read or update the value of a property, you can use the dot notation</li>
<li>A parameter is a variable in a function definition. When a function is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters</li>
<ul>conditions for implicit return:
<li>Your function must be an arrow function.</li>
<li>The function body must be only one statement. This means you must remove the curly braces</li>
<li>You must remove the return keyword because the function body is one statement</li>
</ul>
<li>String .trim() removes all leading and trailing space characters</li>
<li>The Array .every(callback) method returns true when every item in the array satisfies the condition provided in the callback.</li>
<li>.some(callback) method returns true when at least one item in the array satisfies the condition provided in the callback.</li>
<li>The reduce() method is used to calculate a single value from an array.</li>
